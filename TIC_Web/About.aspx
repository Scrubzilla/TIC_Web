    <h2>About us</h2>
    <h3>About the TIC project?</h3>
    <p>This project started a few years ago when our developer Scrubzilla went to college and wanted to develop his java programming his skills. He started working on an offline program written in java which would later evolve to the idea of creating this webpage. The offline program will be downloadable in the future for the people who would want to have an offline version of this website with similar features.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>What is our goal?</h3>
    <p>Our goal is to provide a platform with different kinds of tools for all kinds of Tekken players, beginners to veterans. The goal is to collect as much information as possible in one place and make it easy to view. For the beginners, maybe the learning and tutorial sections are more interesting. The veterans might be more interested in the frame-data and match statistics sections. The community will also be able to give their feedback for changes as well as ideas for tools that could be implemented on the website.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>How will we achieve this?</h3>
    <p>Together with the community, we hope to be able to combine the knowledge that exists of the game with our programming knowledge to reach this goal. So, the community plays a crucial part in making this project a high-quality product. </p>
